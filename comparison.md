Lazy Learning â€“ Classification Using Nearest Neighbors

- Computer vision applications, including optical character recognition and facial recognition in both still images and video 
- Predicting whether a person will enjoy a movie or music recommendation 
- Identifying patterns in genetic data, perhaps to use them in detecting specific proteins or diseases

Strengths
- Simple and effective
- Makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution
- Fast training phase

Weaknesses
- Does not produce a model, limiting the ability to understand how the features are related to the class
- Requires selection of an appropriate k
- Slow classification phase
- Nominal features and missing data require additional processing
